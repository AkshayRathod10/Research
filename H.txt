Here’s the basic syntax for find :

kali >find / ➊ -type f ➋ -name apache2 ➌

First I state the directory in which to start the search, in this case / ➊. Then I specify
which type of file to search for, in this case f for an ordinary file ➋. Last, I give the name
of the file I’m searching for, in this case apache2 ➌.

ps - The ps command is used to display information about processes running on the machine.

cat > hackingskills - to create files.
cat hackingskills - will show the content of the file "hackingskills".
To add, or append, more content to a file, you can use the cat command with a double
redirect ( >> ), followed by whatever you want to add to the end of the file.
cat >> hackingskills

To overwrite that same file. we can use the same command to create the file.
cat > hackingskills

press CTRL ­D to come out of the prompt.
